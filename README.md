## Quantified files

### Bisulfite-seq 

This is fairly straight forward, both Bismark coverage files (ending in `.cov.gz`) or genome-wide cytosine reports are acceptable, with coverage files being preferred as they are generated by default, less unwieldy and more precise (see here for differences between the two different file formats: [difference between coverage and cytosine report files](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/Bismark/blob/master/Docs/FAQ.md#context-changediscrepancy-between-bismark-coverage-and-genome-wide-cytosine-reports))

### RNA-seq

### ChIP-seq/ATAC-seq etc
